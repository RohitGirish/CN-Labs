# Basic Peer-to-Peer Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository walks you through a simple networking experiment using Cisco Packet Tracer. In this setup, we’ll connect two PCs directly and check if they can communicate with each other.

## Objective

The goal of this experiment is to simulate basic peer-to-peer communication by:
- Connecting two PCs with a copper straight-through cable.
- Assigning each PC a unique IP address.
- Using the `ping` command to test the connection between them.

## What You’ll Need

- Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system
- Two PC devices (PC0 and PC1)
- One copper straight-through cable

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Start a New Network

Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open a new, empty project.

### 2. Add the Devices

Drag two PCs into the workspace — name them PC0 and PC1 for clarity.

### 3. Connect the PCs

Use a copper straight-through cable to connect:
- PC0’s FastEthernet0 port to
- PC1’s FastEthernet0 port

### 4. Assign IP Addresses

Click on each PC, go to the **Desktop** tab, then **IP Configuration**, and enter the following:

**PC0:**
- IP Address: `192.168.1.1`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

**PC1:**
- IP Address: `192.168.1.2`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

### 5. Test the Connection

On PC0, open the **Command Prompt** (found in the Desktop tab) and run:
